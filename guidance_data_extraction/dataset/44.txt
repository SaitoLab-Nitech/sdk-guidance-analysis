Libraries and SDKs If your app has libraries or SDKs that transmit data from the user's device, specify this regardless of where the information is sent: to you or to a third-party server.
WebView If user data is collected in WebView components that are open in your app, report it provided that the app controls the execution of the WebView code or interaction with this component. If the user uses the WebView component to go to a page outside the app, there is no need to report data collection.
Temporary processing If user data is transmitted from the device and processed temporarily, report it in the form. The information won't be reflected in the data safety section in Google Play if the data is stored only in the server memory and no longer than it is required to execute a certain request in real time. For example, processing data in a weather app that transmits information about the user's location to get weather information. In this case, the data is stored only in memory and is deleted after the request is executed.  Important.  Using data to create advertising or other user profiles can't be considered temporary processing and must be indicated as collection or transmission for the relevant purposes.
Pseudonymization If data is collected using pseudonymization, specify this in the form. For example, if the pseudonymized data can somehow be linked to the user again, you should report its collection.

Off-device transmission (between servers) For example, user data collected in the app is transmitted from your server to a third-party server.
Transmission to another app on the device User information is transmitted from your app to another app on the same device. Report this in the data safety section even if the app doesn't send information from the device.
Transmission from libraries and SDKs The data collected in the app is transmitted directly to a third party through the built-in libraries and/or SDKs.
Transmission from WebView components opened in the app User data is transmitted to a third party through the WebView component running in the app. Report this if the app controls the execution of the WebView code or interaction with this component. If users use the WebView component to go to a page outside the app, there is no need to make a notice about data transmission.

Encryption during transmission Specify whether data is encrypted when transmitted from the end user's device to the server. Some apps enable users to send data to third-party sites or services. For example, a messaging app may have the function to send an SMS via a mobile operator that uses other encryption methods. Then the data safety section will indicate that information is transmitted between the user's device and the app servers over a secure connection.
Deletion request Report whether users can request their data be deleted.
