About Google Play's Data Safety section
In May 2021, Google rolled out a new  Data Safety Section  in the Play Console, where developers must declare their apps' privacy and security practices such as: Collected data : type of data collected and purposes of the data collection.  Data shared : data collected and communicated with third parties.  Security practices and data handling.
Information provided by developers is shown in your app listing on the PlayStore, allowing final users to know the kind of data your app collects before installing your app.
‚ö†Ô∏è Important note  : Developers will be required to fill in the Data Safety form in the Play Console before July 20th, 2022.
