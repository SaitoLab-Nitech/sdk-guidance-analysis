Data Collection
Overview of data collection and controls provided by the Airship SDK.
Privacy Manager
Data collected by the Airship SDK can be controlled using Privacy Manager flags. Each flag enables additional Airship features within the SDK and controls what data is collected. The flags are for individual or groups of functional features within the SDK. Some Airship features, such as contact tags, require multiple feature flags to be enabled.
SDK Data Collection
All SDK features are enabled by default, but the SDK can be configured to disable all or a subset of features on start. If the SDK is initialized without any features enabled, it will not store any data or make any network requests. If the SDK features are disabled after being previously enabled, it may make a few network requests to opt the channel out to prevent notifications.
The data collected automatically by the SDK is not used to track users across apps.
1. iOS 15+ only
App Data Collection
In addition to the data automatically collected by the SDK, the app can provide data to the SDK for collection: Data Privacy
Airship makes HTTPS encryption (also referred to as TLS connection) available for data in transit to or from the Service, for more information see Airship Security Measures. Data collected by the SDK is not transferred to any third parties unless a partner integration is enabled and configured by the application. For information on individual data requests, see Individual Data Privacy Rights.
Using Privacy Manager
The Privacy Manager allows setting default enabled features as well as modifying the enabled features at runtime. This table provides a mapping of the flags: Privacy Manager Flags

Configuring Default Enabled Features
Default enabled features can be set in the Airship Config options.

Modifying Enabled Features
Features can be enabled and disabled at any time after takeOff. Once a feature set is modified from the default, those settings will be persisted in the SDK between app inits.
