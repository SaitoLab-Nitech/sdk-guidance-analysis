Google Play Data safety
According to Google’s data safety requirement, app developers need to inform users about collecting data.
The table below shows the information MyTracker SDK collects. The data is given in the classification offered by Google and can be used in Data safety section on your behalf.
Please note that this is describing MyTracker SDK in the default configuration, so before you transmit data to Google Play Console, make sure to compare the following default configuration to your specific SDK configuration.
Nothing stated here is legal advice, and it is provided primarily for your convenience according to MyTracker understanding of the Google guidelines. We recommend that you work closely with legal to determine exactly how Google policies and any applicable laws apply to your application based on your practice and data use purposes.
Data collection and security#Copy URL
In this section, you need to give answer "Yes" or "No" to the following questions: Whether or not your app collects or shares any of the required data types. [[[{ENC}Whether or not all of the user data collected by your app is encrypted in transit]]]. [[[{DEL}Whether or not you provide a way for users to request that their data is deleted]]].
[[[{ENC}MyTracker serializes all data in transit that is transmitted through the SDK]]]. [[[{DEL}MyTracker also provides app developers with the ability to delete user data by sending a request to support@tracker.my.com]]].
Data types#Copy URL
Data sharing#Copy URL
MyTracker is the third-party system for product and marketing analytics for your application. When filling out the information in Google Play regarding the purposes of data collection, note that the Collected block relates to the purposes of data collection by the application, and the Shared block relates to the purposes of third-party collection.
Ephemeral processing#Copy URL
Ephemerally processing means accessing and using it while the data is only stored in memory and retained for no longer than necessary to service the specific request in real-time.
Given the nature of the services provided by MyTracker, the processing of data cannot be treated as ephemeral.
User control#Copy URL
App developers have the ability to control data collection and request appropriate permissions from users. Fill the Data safety section following specific app configuration.
Purposes#Copy URL
Google proposes several categories of data use, select purposes that are more relevant to your practice: Was this article helpful?
