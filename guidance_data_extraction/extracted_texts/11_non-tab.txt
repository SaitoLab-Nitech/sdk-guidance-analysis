How to use information on this page
This page lists the end-user data collected by only the  latest versions  of the Taboola Android SDK (Android SDK and React-Native)
If you are using a prior version of the Taboola SDK, consider updating to the latest version to ensure your app's disclosures are accurate. The Taboola SDK will continue to be updated over time. This article will reflect these changes, so make sure to check back and update your disclosures as necessary.
To complete your data disclosure, you can use Android's  guide  about data types to help you determine which data types and purposes best describe the collected data. In your data disclosure, make sure to also account for how your specific app shares and uses the collected data.
