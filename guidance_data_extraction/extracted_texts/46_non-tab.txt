Resources for Completing App Store Data Practice Questionnaires for Apps That Include the Facebook or Audience Network SDK
July 18, 2022
Subscribe to Developer news
Updated July 18: Developers and advertising partners may be required to share information on their app’s privacy practices in third party app stores, such as Google Play and the Apple App Store, including the functionality of SDKs provided by Meta. To help make it easier for you to complete these requirements, we have consolidated information that explains our data collection practices for the Facebook and Audience Network SDKs.
Facebook SDK
To provide functionality within the Facebook SDK, we may receive and process certain contact, location, identifier, and device information associated with Facebook users and their use of your application. The information we receive depends on what SDK features 3rd party applications use and we have structured the document below according to these features.
App Ads, Facebook Analytics, & App Events
Facebook App Events  allow you to measure the performance of your app using  Facebook Analytics  ,  measure conversions  associated with Facebook ads, and  build audiences  to acquire new users as well as re-engage existing users. There are a number of different ways your app can use app events to keep track of when people take specific actions such as installing your app or completing a purchase.
[[[{PRA}With  Facebook SDK  , there are app events that are automatically logged]]] ([[[{DES}app installs, app launches, and in-app purchases]]]) [[[{PRA}and collected for Facebook Analytics unless you disable automatic event logging. Developers determine what events to send to Facebook from a  list of standard events  , or via a custom event]]].
When developers send Facebook custom events, these events could include data types outside of standard events. Developers control sending these events to Facebook either directly via application code or in Events Manager for codeless app events. Developers can review their code and Events Manager to determine which data types they are sending to Facebook. It’s the developer’s responsibility to ensure this is reflected in their application’s privacy policy.
Advanced Matching
Developers may also send us additional user contact information in code, or via the  Events Manager  .  [[[{PRA}Advanced matching  functionality may use the following data, if sent:]]]
[[[{DES}email address, name, phone number, physical address (city, state or province, zip or postal code and country), gender, and date of birth]]].
Facebook Login
There are two scenarios for applications that use  Facebook Login  via the Facebook SDK: Authenticated Sign Up or Sign In, and  User Data Access via Permissions  . For authentication, a unique, app-specific identifier tied to a user’s Facebook Account enables the user to sign in to your app. For Data Access, a user must explicitly grant your app permission to access data.
Note: Since Facebook Login is part of the Facebook SDK, we may collect other information referenced here when you use Facebook Login, depending on your settings.
Device Information
[[[{PRA}We may also receive and process the following information if your app is integrated with the Facebook SDK:]]]
[[[{DAT}Device identifiers;]]],  [[[{DAT}Device attributes]]], [[[{DES}such as device model and screen dimensions, CPU core, storage size, SDK version, OS and app versions, and app package name; and]]],  [[[{DAT}Networking information]]], [[[{DES}such as the name of the mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, and IP address]]].
Audience Network SDK
[[[{PRA}We may receive and process the following information when you use the Audience Network SDK to integrate Audience Network ads in your app:]]]
[[[{DAT}Device identifiers;]]],  [[[{DAT}Device attributes]]], [[[{DES}such as device model and screen dimensions, operating system, mediation platform and SDK versions; and]]],  [[[{DAT}Ad performance information]]], [[[{DES}such as impressions, clicks, placement, and viewability]]].
