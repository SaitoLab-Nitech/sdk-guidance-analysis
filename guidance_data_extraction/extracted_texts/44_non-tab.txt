Data safety in Google Play
Data safety in Google Play
According to the  Google requirements  , mobile app developers should report to Google Play which data they collect through the app. To do this, they need to fill out the  Data safety  form on the  App content  page in the Play Console.
Data collection
Transmitting information from the user's device through the app.
What isn't considered data collection: Local access and processing
You don't need to specify user data that the app processes only on the device.
End-to-end encryption
If user data is encrypted during transmission from the device in such a way that neither you nor anyone else except the sender and recipient can read it, there is no need to report such processing. Encryption keys shouldn't be available to any intermediary, including the developer.
Data transmission
A situation when user data collected in your app is transmitted to third parties.
What isn't considered data transmission: Transmission to service providers
User data is transmitted to the service provider which processes it on behalf of the developer.
Transmission on legal grounds
User data is transmitted for purposes stipulated by law. For example, due to a legal obligation or in response to a request from government agencies.
Transmission based on an action performed by the user or after disclosing information about the use of data and obtaining consent
Data is transmitted to a third party as a result of the actions of the user who understands that their information will be transmitted. The same category includes cases when the app explicitly discloses information about data processing and the user consents to this.
Anonymous data transmission
You are transmitting completely anonymized user data that can't be associated with a specific person.
Mandatory and optional data
For each data type, you can specify whether it is mandatory.
For example, information can be considered optional: If the user can manage its collection and the app can work without it.  If you can choose whether to provide this data manually.
To declare the collection of optional data, make sure that all users, regardless of the device or region, can choose to provide such information and allow or prohibit its transmission.
If information is required to perform the main functions of the app, it must be specified as mandatory.
More information about working with data
You can provide additional information about how data privacy and protection is ensured in your app.
Special icon
Apps designed for children must comply with the Google Play Families Policies. If your app belongs to this category and meets the requirements, you can add the  Complies with the Google Play Families Policies  icon to the data safety section.
To place this icon: In the  Data safety  form, go to the  Data protection  section.
Click  Go to Target audience and content  .
Data types
Information about how user data of each type is collected and transmitted.
Data collection purposes
Information about the data collection purposes.
