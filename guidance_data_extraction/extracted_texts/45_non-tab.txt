Google's Data Safety Form
Starting July 20, 2022, Google Play has mandated all developers to define which data is collected by their apps, including third-party libraries or SDKs integrated within the apps, in accordance with the Google Play Data Safety section form.
To assist with meeting this requirement, DT is providing developers with an easy-to-use guide on our data collection practices in the context of Google’s Play Data Safety details requirement. For each data type, we provide guidance if DT collects this data, and if so, how and for what purpose.
The following tables specify the data that is collected by DT's SDK and can be used to correctly and accurately answer Google’s data safety questionnaire.
The information provided here is intended to assist DT's customers in answering data on behalf of customers. This information does not represent legal advice and customers are required to work with their own professional advisors to determine exactly if and how Google policies apply to them, as well as adapt responses with the customer's specific use case and configuration in mind.
