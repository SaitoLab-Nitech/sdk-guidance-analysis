Google Play Data Safety
Starting in April 2022, Google will be asking publishers to answer questions about their app's privacy and security practices. Below is an outline of how Tapjoy uses each type of data. Only the sections that Tapjoy's services utilitzed were listed. Please be aware that your final answers may be different if you use other partners in your app or if you do not use our full range of products.
(These responses reflect Tapjoy’s collection and use as a provider of in-app advertising monetization services to a publisher, for the data Tapjoy collects and processes routinely and systematically in providing such monetization services. Tapjoy’s answers do not reflect data which a user may voluntarily provide, whether in response to Tapjoy’s market research survey offers in a publisher’s application or in the customer support context.)
Tapjoy has provided the CSV export of these answers here for reference.
