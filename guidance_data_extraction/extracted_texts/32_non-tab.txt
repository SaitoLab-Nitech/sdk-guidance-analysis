Prepare for Google Play’s data disclosure requirements
In May 2021, Google Play announced the new Data safety section, which is a developer-provided disclosure for an app's data-collection, sharing, and security practices.
This page can help you complete the requirements for this data disclosure with regard to your usage of the Google Analytics for Firebase Android SDKs. On this page, you can find information on whether and how our SDKs handle end-user data, including any applicable configurations or invocations you can control as the app developer.
We aim to be as transparent as possible in supporting you; however, as the app developer, you are solely responsible for deciding how to respond to Google Play's Data safety section form regarding your app's end-user data-collection, sharing, and security practices.
How to use the information on this page
This page lists the end-user data collected by the latest version of the Google Analytics for Firebase SDK. This article provides information about data collected automatically versus data collected depending on your usage of the SDK. Automatic collection means that the SDK collects specific data (example) without you invoking any specific method or class in your app. However, in many cases, the data collected by the SDK depends on your app's specific usage of the product, meaning your app's configuration and how you invoke the SDK.
To complete your data disclosure, you can use Android's guide about data types to help you determine which data type best describes the collected data. In your data disclosure, make sure to also account for how your specific app shares and uses the collected data.
Data collected automatically
[[[{SDK}The Google Analytics for Firebase SDK]]] [[[{PRA}collects]]] [[[{DAT}the following data]]] [[[{CON}automatically]]].
[[[{ENC}All of the user data collected by the SDK is encrypted in transit using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol]]].
Data collected depending on your usage
[[[{CON}Depending on how you configure or invoke the Google Analytics for Firebase SDK and the product's features, your app may collect end-user data that needs to be included in your data disclosure]]]. The following table lists examples of end-user data that can be collected depending on your usage, but make sure to account for any data collected by your specific usage.
Other considerations
For details on how the product processes your end user’s personal data, review the Google Analytics Terms, Ads Processing Terms, and Use Policy.
Additionally, review optional features that may impact your data collection and usage: Activating Google signals, Linking a Google Ads account and exporting conversions or audiences, Enabling Data Sharing Settings with Google products & services.
If you are using any optional product features that involve additional data or participating in any tests of new product features that involve additional data, be sure to check if those features or tests require additional data disclosures.
If you are using a prior version of the Google Analytics for Firebase SDK, consider updating to the latest version to ensure your app's disclosures are accurate.
