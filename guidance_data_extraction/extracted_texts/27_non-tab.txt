The information you provide will be shown on your store listing to help users better understand your app’s privacy, security, and data handling practices before they download it.
Google Play will soon require additional details in the Data Safety section on the Google Play store. Developers will be required to tell Google about their apps’ privacy and security practices by completing a form in Play Console. Starting in late April 2022, this information will be shown on your app’s store listing to help Google Play users understand how your app collects and shares user data before they download your app. The Data Safety section on Google Play is a simple way for you to help people understand what user data your app collects or shares, as well as showcase your app’s key privacy and security practices. This information helps users make more informed choices when deciding which apps to install.
This document will help you know how to answer the Google Play Data safety questionnaire for the Apptentive SDK.
