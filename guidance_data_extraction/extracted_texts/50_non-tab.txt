Google Play Data Safety Requirements
Suggest Edits
Starting July 20, 2022, Google will require a privacy disclosure for all new apps and app updates. You will need to complete the Data safety section in the App Privacy tab in the  Google Play Console  . Instructions from Google can be found  here  . As OneSignal is a third-party to your app, you’ll need to ensure you are properly disclosing the ways you are handling user data with OneSignal.
By default, OneSignal only collects Purchases (in-app) and App interactions (clicks and session duration) for Android apps. Users who set up and collect emails, phone numbers, or additional data through Data Tags or Outcomes will need to disclose these additional data types.
Please review the following data types when filling out your Data safety details. For details on handling user data, see  Handling Personal Data  .

Required Data Types
OneSignal collects App interactions as well as Purchase history if your app has in-app purchases.
If you are using OneSignal for any of the other options listed or have set up additional data collection through OneSignal, you will need to disclose those options as well.
Type: Purchase history
If your app has in-app purchases, you must disclose that your app collects ‘Purchase history’ information under the ‘Financial info’ section.
This information is not processed ephemerally and is required for use in OneSignal’s dashboard features including Segments and Outcomes. For OneSignal, at a bare minimum, you must select ‘Analytics’. If you are using OneSignal for any of the other options listed or have set up additional data collection, you will need to select those options as well.
Additional Selections
If you are using OneSignal for any of the other options listed or have set up additional data collection through OneSignal, you will need to select those options as well.
Type: App interactions
You must disclose that your app collects App interactions information under the ‘App activity’ section.
This information is not processed ephemerally and is required for use in OneSignal’s dashboard features including Segments and Outcomes. For OneSignal, at a bare minimum, you must select ‘Analytics’ and ‘Developer communications’. If you are using OneSignal for any of the other options listed or have set up additional data collection, you will need to select those options as well.
Additional Selections
If you are using OneSignal for any of the other options listed or have set up additional data collection through OneSignal, you will need to select those options as well.
After making your privacy selections, Google will show your store listing preview. If you have chosen Purchase history and App interactions as described above, your details should look like this: If the way you set up and collect data changes in the future, you should return to the Play Console to edit your responses.
