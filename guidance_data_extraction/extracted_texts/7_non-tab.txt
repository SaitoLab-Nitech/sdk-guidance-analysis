In May 2021, Google Play announced the new Data safety section, which is a developer-provided disclosure for an app's data collection, sharing, and security practices.
This page can help you complete the requirements for this data disclosure in regards to your usage of the Google Mobile Ads SDK. On this page, you can find information on whether and how our SDK handles end-user data, including any applicable settings or configurations you can control as the app developer.
We aim to be as transparent as possible in supporting you; however, as the app developer, you are solely responsible for deciding how to respond to Google Play's Data safety section form regarding your app's end-user data collection, sharing, and security practices.
How to use the information on this page
This page lists the end-user data collected by only the latest version (version 21.5.0) of the Google Mobile Ads SDK.
If you are using a prior version of the Google Mobile Ads SDK, consider updating to the latest version to ensure your app's disclosures are accurate. The Google Mobile Ads SDK will continue to be updated over time. This article will reflect these changes, so make sure to check back and update your disclosures as necessary.
To complete your data disclosure, you can use Android's guide about data types to help you determine which data types and purposes best describe the collected data. In your data disclosure, make sure to also account for how your specific app shares and uses the collected data.
If you are also utilizing AdMob Privacy & messaging to collect and manage consent for GDPR, please refer to the User Messaging Platform SDK documentation on Google Play data disclosures.
