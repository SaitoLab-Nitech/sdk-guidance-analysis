Google Data Safety Form Information
By July 20, 2022, Google Play is mandating all developers to define which data is collected by their apps and third-party libraries or SDKs integrated within these apps through the Google Play Data Safety section form.
To assist with meeting this requirement, AdColony is providing developers with an easy-to-use guide on our data collection practices in the context of Google’s Play Data Safety details requirement. For each data type, we provide guidance if AdColony collects this data, and if so, how and for what purpose.
The following table specifies the data that is collected by AdColony’s SDK, and can be used to correctly and accurately answer Google’s data safety questionnaire.
The information provided here is intended to assist AdColony’s customers in answering the Google Safety Section Questionnaire to the extent that AdColony processes relevant data on behalf of customers. This information does not represent legal advice and customers are required to work with their own professional advisors to determine exactly if and how Google policies apply to them and should adapt responses with the customer’s specific use case and configuration in mind.
Data Use
In relevance to Data Collection and Security questions,
[[[{ENC}Is all of the user data collected by your app encrypted in transit?]]] [[[{ENC}Yes, AdColony’s SDK encrypts all data collected in transit]]]. , [[[{DEL}Do you provide a way for users to request that their data be deleted?]]] [[[{DEL}Go to adcolony.com/privacy-policy/ and select from the options at the bottom of the page]]].
