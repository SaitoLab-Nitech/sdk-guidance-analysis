Google Play Console - Data Safety
Guidelines for filling out Razorpay SDK-related data points in Google Play Data Safety form.
The Data Safety section on the Google Play store is a simple way for merchants to help people understand what user data their app collects or shares and showcase their app's key privacy and security practices. This information helps users make more informed choices when installing apps.
By July 20, 2022  , all developers must declare how they collect and handle user data for the apps they publish on Google Play and provide details about how they protect this data through security practices like encryption. This includes data collected and handled through any third-party libraries or SDKs used in their apps.
Who is responsible for providing this data?
Merchant is responsible for making complete and accurate declarations in their app's store listing on Google Play. Google Play reviews apps across all policy requirements; however, Google cannot determine how we use and handle the data on behalf of the developers. Only merchants possess all the information required to complete the Data Safety form.
