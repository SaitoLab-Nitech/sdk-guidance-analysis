In May 2021, Google Play  announced the new Data safety section  , which is a developer-provided disclosure for an app's data collection, sharing, and security practices.
This page can help you complete the requirements for this data disclosure in regards to your usage of Firebase Android SDKs. On this page, you can find information on whether and how our SDKs handle end-user data, including examples of applicable configurations or invocations you can control as the app developer.
We aim to be as transparent as possible in supporting you; however, as the app developer, you are solely responsible for deciding how to respond to Google Play's Data safety section form regarding your app's end-user data collection, sharing, and security practices.
How to use the information on this page
This page lists the end-user data collected by only the   latest version   of each Firebase Android SDK.
Each SDK has its own section later on this page where we provide information about data   collected automatically   versus data   collected depending on your usage   . Automatic collection means that the SDK collects specific data without you invoking any specific method or class in your app. However, in many cases, the data collected by the SDK depends on your app's specific usage of the product, meaning your app's configuration and how you invoke the SDK.
To complete your data disclosure, you can use Android's  guide about data types  to help you determine which   data type   best describes the collected data. In your data disclosure, make sure to also account for how your specific app shares and uses the collected data.
Important  : To help you ensure that your app's disclosures are accurate, we recommend the following: Always use the latest SDK versions in your app. This page lists the data collected by only the latest version of each SDK.  Review this page whenever you update your app's SDK versions. Check that your data disclosures are accurate and up-to-date.
